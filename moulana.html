        <P>Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi was born in 1207 in Balkh, Persia in what is today Afghanistan. His father, Bahāʼ al-Dīn Valad, was a famous religious teacher and mystic who had a position at the university in Balkh. When Mongols invaded Persia, Rumi left Persia for Konya, which was then under the Persian empire. By the time he made it to Konya his mother had died, and he was married with a son.

            Rumi had had his early spiritual education from his father Bahauddin and later his father’s close friend Sayyid Burhaneddin of Balkh. Rumi grew both in knowledge and consciousness of God over the years. Eventually Sayyid Burhaneddin told Rumi that he was now ready and a mature Sufi and scholar and that the 'next stage' of his spiritual development would soon occur. And so Sayyid predicted the coming of Shams of Tabriz, the central event and love of Rumi’s life.
            
            At the age of 37, Rumi met the spiritual vagabond and holy-man, Shams. It was his meeting with this dervish on 15 November, 1244 that completely changed his life. Much has been written about their relationship. Before this encounter Rumi had been an eminent professor of religion and a highly attained mystic; after this he became an inspired poet and a great lover of humanity.[6] Shams’ companionship with Rumi was brief. Despite the fact that each was a perfect mirror for the other, Shams disappeared, not once but twice. The first time, Rumi’s son Sultan Veled searched for him and found him in Damascus.The second disappearance, however, proved to be final, and it is believed that he may have been murdered by orthodox Muslim theologians, and other people of Konya who resented his influence over Rumi.</P>

            <p>Shams convinced Rumi that at certain moments it was possible to commune directly with God: Rather than believers simply being interpreters of the word of God, they could experience his presence directly.

                The effect on Rumi was immediate: abandoning his familial and scholarly responsibilities he gave all his time to learning as much as possible from Shams. The mystic came and went without explanation, and vanished permanently in 1248. From then on, Rumi devoted himself to poetry, and he primarily wrote about the topic of love. His verses, inspired by Shams—more than 30,000 in all—were collected in a work that he called Diwan-i Shams-i-Tabriz ('The Divan of Shams of Tabriz'). Stylistically, Rumi favoured the well established, ghazal, a traditional Persian meter of up to twelve rhyming lines; and to a lesser extent, the Rubai quartrain form.
                
                Rumi seems to have been permanently engaged in a search of divine inspiration and love. He saw and found his 'Muse'[10] in various human and natural aspects of existence. After the Divan he completed his great masterpiece or magnum opus, the Mathnavi-i Ma'navi ('The Mathnavi/Treatise Devoted to the Intrinsic Meaning of All Things'), which was dictated in its entirety to his student Hissam-ud-din Chelebi over the course of many years.
                
                Although there had been a substantial Islamic mystical tradition prior to Rumi, his poetry transformed both thinking and ritual about it. For example, the famous centripetal dance of the dervishes - the sema ritual - is said to have its inspiration in Rumi's own movements around a pole in his garden as he mourned for his companion Shams. In time, these actions were adapted into Sufic practise by Rumi and then handed down to his favoured disciples who institutionalized them into the activities of the Mevlevi Order that they founded in their Master's honour.
                
                Rumi died on December 17, 1273 AD and his Urs (Spiritual anniversary/festival) is held every year on 8th December at his Turbe (shrine) in Konya. </p>
