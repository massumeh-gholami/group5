        <h1>Hafez</h1>
        <p>One of the books you can find in every Iranian house is the poem book of “Divan-e Hafez”. The great Iranian poet and mystic can touch your soul and get into your heart only by reading a couple of verses. You can see all kinds of figures of speech in his elegant poems. His poetic talk can make you fall in love, be positive, have hope, recover after a heartbreaking situation, and most of all, live the moment. He lived centuries ago but still exerts a powerful influence today.</p><br>
        <h2>Life of Hafez</h2>
        <p>The life of the great Shirazi poet, Hafez is shrouded in mystery despite his profound popularity and influence on Iranian literature and culture. There are different ideas and comments about the early life of this great Shirazi poet and there is not a single source to rely on. This amazing poet lived in the 8th century, one of the most chaotic times in history. He knew all the science, religion, language, and literature of his time, he played a musical instrument, and most important of all, Hafez was a socialist and critic. That is why he mostly cared about society more than his poems.</p><br>
        <h2>Titles of Hafez</h2>
        <p>In Iranian language and culture, a person who has memorized the Quran successfully is called “Hafez”. And our beloved Hafez was one of the memorizers and used it as his pen name. He is also entitled “Lisan Ul-Qeyb”, which literally means “the language of unseen”. Since people believed he is talking with God and these are the words of “unseen”. </p><br>
        <h2>Day of Hafez – Memorial Day of the Great Poet</h2>
        <p>October 12th is celebrated as Hafez Day in Iran. Many scholars, writers, and his lovers from all over the world travel to Iran and celebrate this day in his mausoleum in Shiraz. They gather to read his poems, admit how great he was in poem writing, and how he mirrored the 8th century to many generations after that.</p><br><hr>

        <figcaption>The book of Hafez is very precious to Iranians. Many Iranians use Divan-e Hafez for fortune-telling. Every Iranian family has it in their house, and when they get together during the Nowruz or Yalda Night, they open the Divan to a random page and read the poem on it, which they believe to be an indication of things that will happen in the future or it shows how a person feels at the moment.</figcaption><br><hr>
