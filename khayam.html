            <h1>Khayyam</h1>
            <p>Hakim Abul-Fath Umar Ibn Ibrahim Al-Khayami, known as "Khayyam", an Iranian philosopher, mathematician, astrologer and poet, was born in 439 AH in Neishabur. He cooperated in arranging the observation of Malekshahi and modifying the Jalali calendar. He has poems in Persian and Tazi and books in both languages. Among his works in mathematics and algebra, dealing with treatise fi Sharh Ma Ashkel Man Musharsat of Euclid's book, treatise fi al-ahtiyal to know the quantity of gold and al-fadah fi jezam mikre manhama, and al-Azhar al-Makna can be mentioned. He died in 526 AH. His quatrains are world famous.</p> <br><br><p>One of his most outstanding works can be said to be organizing and overseeing the calculations of Iranian chronology during the ministry of Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk, which was during the reign of Malik Shah Seljuq (426-490 AH). The calculations attributed to Khayyam in this field are still valid and the accuracy is at the highest point of chronology. He was a professor in mathematics, astronomy, literary, religious and historical sciences. Khayyam's role in solving cubic equations and his studies on Euclid's fifth principle have recorded his name as an outstanding mathematician in the history of science.</p>

            <h1>((Achievements))</h1>
            <h3>Mathematics</h3><br>
            Khayyam I is the one who carried out regular scientific research in equations of the first, second and third degrees, and brought an admirable classification of these equations, and systematically researched the solution of all forms of equations of the third degree, and their (in most cases incomplete) geometric solutions He succeeded, and his treatise on the science of algebra, which includes this research, represents a systematic scientific thought; And this treatise is one of the most prominent medieval works and probably the most prominent among them in this science.

            <h3>((Philosophy))</h3>
            <p>So far, five philosophical treatises have been found from Khayyam, which are: Fi al-Kun and al-Taklif, Fi al-Wujud, Al-Diya al-Aqli in the subject of al-Ilam al-Kali, Al-Jawb on three issues; The necessity of contradiction in Al-Alam, al-Jabr, al-Baqa and in the science of the universals of existence. Among these, the only treatise on the science of the universals of existence is in Persian and the others are in Arabic. Also, at the request of a group of Esfahani scholars, Khayyam made a Persian translation of Ibn Sina's Tawheed sermon in 472 AH.</p><br>

            <h3>((the literature))</h3>
            <p>Khayyam spent his life as a famous mathematician and philosopher, while his contemporaries were unaware of the quatrains that are the source of his fame and honor today. [86] Khayyam's contemporaries such as Nizami Prozodi or Abul Hasan Bayhaqi did not mention Khayyam's poetry.[87] Sadegh Hedayat says about this:

                It seems that Khayyam's songs during his lifetime were hidden and uncategorized due to the dryness of the people's brains, and were only known among a group of close and close friends of his, or they were recorded on the sidelines of wars and books by people with taste in a way that he wrote a few quatrains, and after His death has been published.</p><br>
